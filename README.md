## Why Use a Blockchain?
The use of a blockchain provides resilience to possible downfalls found on centralized systems such as data loss, company bankruptcy, takeovers, or product discontinuation. It also means that your decision is executed exactly as you want it without inteference of any kind. In other words, your decision is final.
